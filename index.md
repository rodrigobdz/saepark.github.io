Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. I am mainly interested in organizational theory, knowledge management, and organizational learning. 

Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives shape agents' performance and knowledge-related outcomes. My current research examines these themes in the contexts of bias in third-party regulation, information systems use in organizations, and foreign labor migration in developing economies.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and my MA in international economics from Seoul National University in Korea and dabbled in edtech entrepreneurship. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, attending concerts, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
