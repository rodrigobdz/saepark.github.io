Welcome! I am a third year PhD candidate in Organizational Behavior & Theory at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. I am interested in organizational economics, organizational learning, and behavioral strategy. 

Broadly, I explore how the interplay of pecuniary and social incentives, market shifts, and risk salience ultimately shape agents' performance and behavioral outcomes. My current research examines these themes in the contexts of third-party regulation, information systems usage in organizations, and labor market mobility in developing economies. I am currently working with firms in Southeast Asia to utilize proprietary archival data and run field experiments for my work.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my BBA and Master's degrees from Seoul National University in Korea. In my free time, I enjoy boxing, mountaineering, listening to music, and cheering for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
